# Build Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### 1. Package.json Dependencies
**Problem**: Missing and outdated dependencies causing build failures
**Solution**: 
- Updated Next.js to v14.2.0
- Added missing ESLint configuration
- Moved TypeScript types to devDependencies
- Added proper version constraints

### 2. TypeScript Configuration
**Problem**: Incorrect TypeScript settings causing compilation errors
**Solution**:
- Updated target to ES2017 for better compatibility
- Added `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` for cross-platform consistency
- Fixed module resolution settings

### 3. Next.js Configuration
**Problem**: Deprecated `experimental.appDir` setting causing warnings
**Solution**:
- Removed deprecated settings (app directory is now stable)
- Added proper image domains configuration
- Set output to standalone for better deployment

### 4. NextAuth Configuration
**Problem**: Exported `authOptions` from API route causing type conflicts
**Solution**:
- Moved `authOptions` to separate `/lib/auth.ts` file
- Updated all imports to use new location
- Simplified API route handler

### 5. Suspense Boundary Issue
**Problem**: `useSearchParams` in error page not wrapped in Suspense
**Solution**:
- Added proper Suspense boundary with fallback
- Separated component logic for better error handling

### 6. Missing Environment Types
**Problem**: Missing Next.js environment type definitions
**Solution**:
- Created `next-env.d.ts` file with proper Next.js type references
